Second semester. Course "Programming : Algorithms and Data Structures". Second lab on C++.

Implementing *String* class via *ArraySequence* and *ListSequence* which both uses *ISequence* as interface and they both are just wrapper for basic classe as *DynamicArray* and *List*.

*Utils* is used for exception handling and some debug features.

<class>Implementation.hpp is just file with definitions of <class>. I use it to separate declaration and definitions.
